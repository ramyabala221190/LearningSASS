SASS-Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

Why SASS over CSS ?

1. Reduced maintainance cost because of reusability
2. Lesser boilerplate
3. Better organisation
4. Improved readability
5. Reduced Duplication
6. Calculated values

A .scss file is nothing but CSS + SASS features.
The .scss file is run through  sass, which is a css preprocessor. 
This sass preprocessor will produce a regular .css file.
